# RomanPlumbing

A basic example retail website using react + .NET 8. 

Once running, click the populate products button on the home page. 

Once clicked, go to the baths page and you can select a product, which will allow you to view the description. 

Once you click buy, you can enter some basic details (added validation for a couple of fields) and then takes you to an order summary page with your order details. 

# Notes
Ran out of time, but ideally would like to be able to allow customers to chose quantities of products, and add multiple items to a basket to checkout at once with.
Would also like to add stock keeping, and potentially offers/voucher code functionality.
